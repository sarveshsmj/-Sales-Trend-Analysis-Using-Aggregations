## üìä Online Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes synthetic online sales data (CSV with 100+ rows) containing order details like `order_date`, `amount`, and `product_id`. The goal is to understand revenue trends and customer behavior over time.

### üîç Key Features of Analysis

* **Data Overview:**

  * Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()` for basic understanding.
  * Identified missing values, data types, and basic statistics.

* **Visualizations:**

  * `sns.pairplot()` explored relationships between numerical features.
  * `sns.heatmap()` showed feature correlations.
  * Histograms and boxplots revealed data distribution and outliers.

* **Findings:**

  * **Highly Correlated Features:** Revenue and order volume show seasonal patterns.
  * **Skewed Variables:** Order `amount` is right-skewed with a few high-value outliers.
  * **Outliers:** Significant in `amount`, suggesting premium product orders or fraud risk.
  * **Monthly Trends:** Clear spikes in sales in certain months using `EXTRACT(MONTH)`.

* **SQL Revenue Analysis:**

  * Used PostgreSQL-style queries with `EXTRACT(YEAR/MONTH)` to group by time.
  * Aggregated data with `SUM(amount)` and `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Potential for Feature Engineering

* Create `month`, `year`, or `quarter` features.
* Flag outlier orders.
* Aggregate past order amounts for customer-level metrics.
